# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Journey

This repository documents my **13-week journey learning and implementing Reinforcement Learning (RL)** — combining my **Braude College course (Fall 2025)** with the **University of Alberta’s “Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning” (Coursera)** specialization.

The goal of this repo is to build a **complete, hands-on RL portfolio** — progressing from foundational concepts like *multi-armed bandits* to advanced *deep reinforcement learning and continuous control* algorithms (DQN, Actor–Critic, DDPG, TD3).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the **core principles of RL** — agent–environment loop, rewards, policies, and value functions.  
- Implement and experiment with **key RL algorithms** using **Python, NumPy, PyTorch, and Gymnasium**.  
- Align theory (Sutton & Barto, Alberta modules) with **Braude’s academic lectures and project work**.  
- Build a **modular, week-by-week structure** to showcase learning progress and code clarity.  
- Conclude with a **final capstone project**: *AutoRacer (DDPG → TD3)* — a continuous-control RL agent.

## 🧱 Repository Structure (Growing Weekly)

```
reinforcement-learning-journey/
│
├── week1_bandits/
│   ├── week1_bandits.ipynb        ← 10-Armed Bandit experiment (ε-greedy, optimistic init, UCB)
│   ├── README.md                  ← Theory summary + experiment results
│   └── plots/                     ← Generated figures and comparisons
│
├── assets/                        ← Diagrams, figures, presentation visuals (later)
│
├── requirements.txt               ← Dependencies for all notebooks
└── README.md                      ← (You’re here)
```

Each week will be added as a new folder (e.g. `week2_mdp_gridworld`, `week3_dynamic_programming`, …),  
following the same consistent format — notebook, sub-README, and plots/results.
